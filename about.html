                    MARHABA Laboratories (Pvt) Ltd. was conceived by Hakeem Muhammad Usman during his student days at Tibbia College Lahore where, he would often ponder over the reasons for the decline of Oriental Pharmacy which had such a glorious, past and a comprehensive pharmacopoeia withstanding the test of time for a thousand years. He felt hurt to see this rich heritage being lost and people falling prey to gimmicks and slogan mongering of the contemporary pharmaceutical industry which has converted this noble profession, in service to humanity and Allah into just another mass production industry with the sole objective of selling the product and earning huge profits
                    After that graduation, Hakeem Muhammad Usman along with four younger brothers established MARHABA Laboratories (Pvt) Ltd. on the 1st of July 1975. The aim was to produce oriental  medicines and natural dietary supplements in a modern and scientific manner so that the age old prescriptions and remedies reach the customer in a ready to use form without in any way affecting their efficacy and natural qualities.
                    It was indeed a very tall enterprise and resources were limited. The start was, therefore, very modest but dedication to the cause, honest approach and stringent quality control, more than compensated the financial inadequacies. Soon, the reward came in the shape of unprecedented public appreciation and encouragement due to the purity of natural herbal products
                    From then on there was no looking back. Today, MARHABA Laboratories (Pvt) Ltd. is a household name with its literal meaning (Bravo, Weldone, Welcome) not only in Pakistan but all over the world where Asian and other people conversant with the efficacy of oriental medicines live.

                    MARHABA Laboratories (Pvt) Ltd. is the brainchild of "Hakeem Muhammad Usman", and its inception goes back to the days when he himself was a student at Tibbia College Lahore. Greatly inspired by the rich past of Oriental pharmacy and worried over its contemporary downfall , "Hakeem Muhammad Usman" contemplated on how to evolve this noble profession of service to mankind once again ,
                    It was never too late to accomplish his dreams , and due to his pervasive work into making this profession a credible one, Hakeem Muhammad Usman finally transformed his vision into reality and founded MARHABA Laboratories (Pvt) Ltd. with the help of his siblings in July 1975.<br />
                    Soon after its inception, the institute started working on researching on herbal medicines and other natural  products to produce result-oriented pharmaceutical medicines and natural dietary supplements. With the development of R & D department and induction of devoted staff and qualified scientists, prescriptions and remedies started reaching the end consumer in a ready to use form
                    MARHABA Laboratories (Pvt) Ltd. is indeed the philanthropy of one man whose courage and determination made Marhaba an influential name in the industry. Today, the natural herbal products of MARHABA Laboratories (Pvt) Ltd. have become the household items not only inside Pakistan, but their demand is equally high abroad where people believe in the efficacy of Oriental Medicines.
